# Recogni
It is a basic face detector that uses simple OpenCV in Python for detection. Add images to a folder and then add it into the code. It then converts the RGB colour to Grayscale for optimized processing
It uses Haar Cascade as it's main face detector. Remember to edit the "Path to image" target to your image keeping folder & edit the camera Index number if needed.

Be sure to install the Python OpenCV package by using the following bash script and running it in Command Prompt:    pip install opencv-python
Use the camIndexFinder Python file to find your camera's index number.
